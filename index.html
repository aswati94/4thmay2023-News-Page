    <img src="./img/10.png" alt="mamta banerjee">
    <p>Elaborating on the rules of the four-year UG format that the state will adopt from this year, the CM said: "Those who want to pursue major subjects will get their degrees after three years but those who want to pursue Honours will be required to study for four years. This is the new policy framed by the UGC. Its advantage is that that the Masters course will be of one year instead of two. So, the duration (UG + PG) will be the same but the structure will be slightly different. If other states follow this system and we don't, our students will be unable to compete with them and suffer."</p>
